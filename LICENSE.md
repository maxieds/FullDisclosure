## Licensing 

### License for my modifications to the source code base

I will use a GPL-V3 license for my new work on the source code for this project, 
with a slight non-traditional flavor expressed as below. 

### Android OS licensing 

### List of OSS projects we have drawn upon and their gracious usage policies


### A strategy for non-free, freeware apps from the Google Play Store


### Caveats to *my* licensing permissions which reflect my opinionation at my experience with the black-hat genre

Many of the developers and proprietors of the open source security tools included in this project are 
thanked graciously for their time and efforts on the superb code work. On the other hand, part of what 
informs my strategy and motivations for developing the features that are the most important to me here, 
is my extreme and abnormal diet of having my personal hardware's desecrated by ethically lesser individuals. 
I could, I suppose, issue honorary troll bastard badges, but instead I am going to choose to purposely 
exclude a few named individuals from taking part in something they would probably take for granted and 
use nefariously anyways. They are few, but I have a short list and no one is being forced to read the 
in-source documentation I have prepared when there will be a WIKI with awesome glamour usage shots. 
To these jackasses of their hats, I issue:

* Dear Kevon of Florida, Get the fuck out of my math office and recognize that this Linux will always 
exceed your Mac. And Edward, I showed unwilling but consistent restraint as you reconed me 
a "well you're here ain't ya?" For this, ye shall pass. 
* Mr. Jas0n Zych: Contrary to your attitude and your excessive ego, I have progressed enough to recognize 
and be on solid ground in pointing out that you we're hired to preach what we now have GraphViz for. 
I am not turned on my your continued harassment and transparent public denials, and quite honestly have 
found myself more shocked and scared of the stalking arrangement you have subjevted me to for years. 
Your best years of integer sequence editorial status are now behind you. I have recently enough texted 
someone who might really actually hit you hard for thinking it's so damn funny to forward me spam messages 
about a colleague's desparate need for "stretch mark cream", or whatever. The next time you prescribe me 
70mg of short-acting Vyvanse tablets as a ruse, please make sure that you bookmark the 
finer points of your know-it-all doctorate for me. I'd really like to be taking a little more.

* Bill Casper O'Reilly, who I am aware installed point-and-click pay-for-play malware on my Samsung Galaxy III 
phone (another once nice gadget) and probably on my new shiny iPad with the fancy Belkin keyboard. This 
individual truly deserves to die, but I am too sane to to it myself. 
* Patina Madreno and Nameless Apple, and el Binaca Zozayhaha round out my trolled out blacklist.
